To visit the website : 

Difficulties : 
- Footer doesn't have the same properties on every page. I didn't have the time to find the solution. It worked properly only on the first page.
- Gallery pagination : didn't have the time to set the arrows
- The font doesn't have the best responsiveness

Satisfied about :
- The design is quite similar to what I wanted at the first place
- The navbar worked without difficulties

My pictures were taken from
- https://pixabay.com/fr/
- https://www.pexels.com/fr-fr/
- And were cropped & resized via https://www.photoresizer.com/

To be attentive in the future :
- Font-style : from the beggining of the project
- Being carefull about different classes to use in CSS
- To get a better understanding of bootstrap ROWS.
